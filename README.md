# Tower-of-Hanoi
### 📜 Project Overview
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle. The objective is to move a set of disks from one rod to another, following specific rules:

- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
- A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
- All disks must be moved from the source rod to the destination rod using an auxiliary rod.

### 🚀 Features
- Recursive Solution: Solves the problem using a recursive approach to find the optimal solution for any number of disks.
- Interactive Input: Users can specify the number of disks.
- Step-by-Step Instructions: Outputs each move to the console in a clear format.
- Optimized for Large Inputs: Efficient handling of puzzles with both small and large disk counts.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Language: Java
- Concepts: Recursion, Stack Operations, Algorithmic Problem-Solving
